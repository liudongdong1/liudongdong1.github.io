#### 🍓 Present the grammatical units that form a hierarchical order.
Hierarchy of grammatical units:
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
1. A text consists of one or more sentences.
2. A sentence consists of one or more clauses.
3. A clause consists of one or more  phrases.
4. A phrase consits of one or more words.
5. A word consists of one or more morphemes
{{< /details >}}
#### 🍉 Define morpheme, free morpheme, bound morpheme,morph and allomorph
##### what is morpheme
{{<hide-text hide="A morpheme is the minimal distinctive grammatical unit, and is the lowest unit in grammatical hierarchy. Morphemes are actually abstract elements of analysis. What occurs is an othographic form in writing termed 'morph' which realizes the morpheme.">}}
##### What are free morpheme and bound morpheme?
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
A free morpheme is a morpheme that has a meaning of its own and can be used independenctly. A free morpheme can be a simple word or a root of a derivative.

A bound morpheme is morpheme that hasn't a meaning of its own and can't be used independenctly. A bound morpheme often possess additional or grammatical features.

Generally speaking, free morpheme often carry the meaning and bound morpheme often show grammatical features.
{{< /details >}}
##### What are morph and allomorph
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
A morph is the realization a an othographic form in writing and a phonetic form in speaking of a morpheme.

A allomorph is the indistinctive variant of a morpheme.
{{< /details >}}
#### 🍑 Distinguish root, stem and base as morphological term.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
A root is that part of a word that remains when all affixes haven removed and it is not further analyzable in morphological term.

A stem has to do with inflectional features and is the part that remains when all the inflectional affixes have been removed.

A base is any form to which affixes of any kind can be added.
{{< /details >}}

#### 🥝 What are the semantic and functional defferences between a prefix and suffix.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
The vast majority of prefixes do not chage the original word class, and they tend to be semantically oriented. It adds new meaning to a base.

Suffixes are basically class-changing morphemes, they do not tend to be semantically changed.
{{< /details >}}

#### 🍅 Name at least five methods of word-formation and cite examples for each.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
1. Affixation-a word is fromed by attaching a lesser morpheme, an affix to a base element.
2. Composition-a word is formed by compounding more than one base and this word functions both grammatically and semantically as a single word.
3. Convertion-the derivational process whereby an item is adapted or converted to a new word without the addition of affix.
4. Blending-a word formed from parts of two or more other words.
5. Backformation(逆生法)-formed from verbs.
6. Shortening-is a process whereby part of a word is clipped so that the origainal word is shortended to a smaller word.
7. Acronym(首字母缩略法)-a word coined by putting together the initial letters of a group of words.
{{< /details >}}
#### 🍆 Cite examples for the simple verb phrase, the complex verb phrase,the finite verb phrase and the non-finite verb phrase.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
simple verb phrase: modifier+main verb; I `full appreciate` your work。

complex verb phrase: auxiliary + main verb; Even experts `can make` mistake.

finite verb phrase: She `likes` black coffee.(finite verb bears with the tense maker and in some cases keeps in concord with the subject.)

non-finite verb phrase: She hates `being called` by the wrong name.

{{< /details >}}
#### 🌽 Define the finte clauses and the non-finite clauses.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
finite clauses have subjects and finite verbs as predicates.

non-finite clauses leave subjects unsai and verbs in non-finite forms.
{{< /details >}}
#### 🌶️ Define the simple sentence,the compound sentence and the complex sentence.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
simple: one-clause sentence

compound: more than one clause,which are related to one another by coordination.

complex: more than one clause, which are related to one another by subordination.
{{< /details >}}

#### 🍄 Why do we need to go beyond the sentence and stduy text
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
Because to express a clear and complete idea or thought we need more than one sentence. It's rare that we only use one sentence to expres our idea. When an idea or thought is expressed in more than one sentence, we have text,which relates sentences together. In other words, sentences in text is coherent so that they help each other in expressing a complete idea. The study of the text is to know how sentences can be joined together coherently so that they can best express ideas.

With a rising tone, the question expresses the speaker's neutral expectation of the hearer's response and invites the hearer to verfy the truth of the proposition in the statement. Yet with a falling tone, the speaker asks for the hearer's comfirmation of the statement rather than his verification of the truth.

{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
The defferences between determiners and adjectives are in a number of significant ways:
1. Determiners usually precede adjectives in premodification;
2. the choice of determiners is often determined by the head word but not that of adjectives;
3. adjectives describe the head word by showing its characteristics, but determiners determines the head word by identifying or quantifying

#### 📚 what are generic reference and specific reference
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
Generic reference: It denotes class memberships and it can also refer to a class as a whole. It is realized by a singular countable noun that goes with an indefinite article "a(n)", or a singular countable noun with a definite article "the" or a plural countable noun that goes without an article.

Specific reference: It can be made either in a definite way or in an indefinite way. Definite specifi reference identifies the reerent in question and is realized by a noun with a definite ariticle "the". Indefinite specific reference, however, points to a particular, actual example of the class and it is realized by a singulr countable noun with an indefinite article "a(n)".
{{< /details >}}

#### 💰 Can the definite articles be used for generic reference and the indefinite article for specifi reference.
{{< details "展开查看详情" >}}
The definite article can be used for generic reference. For example, The panda is a rare animal. The panda here still denotes the whole species.

The indefinite article can also be used for specific reference. For example, A dog charged at me when I was on my way home last night.

3. Exception to the rule are the cases where the first noun is premodified by a demonstrative or postmodified by a relative clause.
