到某个点事物必然从无到有。
{{<blank-text hide="At some point something must have come from nothing.">}}

Sophie Amundsen在放学回家的路上。 {{<blank-text hide="Sophie Admundsen was on her way home from school.">}}

有一段路她和Joanna一起走，她们聊着机器人。 {{<blank-text hide="She had walked the first part of the way with Joanna, they had been discussing robots.">}}

Joanna觉得人的脑袋就跟高级电脑差不多。{{<blank-text hide="Joanna thought the human brain was like an advanced computer.">}}

Sophie不太同意-人当然比一个机器高级得多吧？ {{<blank-text hide="Sophie was not certain she agreed. Surely a person was more than a piece of hardware?">}}

她们到了超市就分开了。{{<blank-text hide="When the got to the supermarket they went their seperate ways.">}}

Sophie住在广阔的郊区，到学校的距离差不多是Joanna的两倍。 {{<blank-text hide="Sophie live on the outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost tiwice as far to school as Joanna.">}}

除了她自家的园子外没有其他房屋，这样使得她家就在世界的尽头似的。 {{<blank-text hide="There were no other houses beyond her garden, which made it seem as if her house lay at the end of the world.">}}

前面就是森林了，她从拐角进入了Clover Close. {{<blank-text hide="This was where the woods began. She turned the corner into Clover Close.">}}

路的尽头是一个急转弯，被称为Captain's Bend. {{<blank-text hide="At the end of the road there was a sharp bend, known as Captain's Bend.">}}

人们很少走这条路，除非是周末。 {{<blank-text hide="People seldom went that way except on the weekend.">}}
