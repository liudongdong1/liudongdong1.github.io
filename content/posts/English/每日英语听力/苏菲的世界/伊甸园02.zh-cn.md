五月初，一些园子里，水仙花已经开放满在果树的周围。
{{<blank-text hide="It was early May. In some of the gardens the fruit trees were encircled with dense clusters of daffodils.">}}

赤杨树已经长出了嫩绿的叶子。
{{<blank-text hide="The birches were already in pale green leaf.">}}

每年这个时候万物复苏，多么美妙啊！
{{<blank-text hide="It was extraodinary how everything burst forth at this time of year!">}}

天气回暖和所有的雪都融化了的时候，是什么驱使无数花草树木从荒芜的大地生长开来?
{{<blank-text hide="What made this great mass of green vegetation come welling up from the dead earth as soon as it got warm and the last traces of snow disapeared?">}}

当Sophie打开花园的门时，她看了看信箱。
{{<blank-text hide="As Sophie opened her garden gate, she looked in the mailbox.">}}

通常是一堆垃圾邮件和妈妈的大信封，堆放在厨房的桌子上她回到房间开始写作业。
{{<blank-text hide="There was usually a lot of junk mail and a few big envelopes for her mother,a pile to dump on the kitchen table before she went up to her room to start her homework.">}}

偶尔也有一些银行寄给她爸爸的信，不过Sophie的爸爸不一般。
{{<blank-text hide="From time to time there would be a few letters from the bank for her father, but then he was not a normal father.">}}

Sophie的爸爸是一艘大油轮的船长，几乎一年都在外面。
{{<blank-text hide="Sophie's father was the captain of a big oil tanker, and was away for most of the year.">}}

有几个星期他在家，他会上下细心打点，为母女俩把房子整理得漂亮舒适。
{{<blank-text hide="During the few weeks at a time when he was at home, he would shuffle around the house making it nice and cozy fo Sophie and her mother.">}}

但是当他出海后却显得离她们遥远无比。
{{<blank-text hide="But when he was at sea he could seem very distant.">}}
