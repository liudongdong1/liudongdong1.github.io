### 长荣海运年终奖发 40 个月薪、国际大事

Evergreen reportedly `doles out` generous year-end bonuses for employees

据报道，长荣为员工`发放`丰厚的年终奖

Evergreen Marine(美[məˈrin]英[məˈriːn]) Corp, the largest container shipping company in Taiwan, reportedly `doled out` year-end bonuses of `as much as` 40 months' wages to some of its employees on Thursday.

据报道，台湾最大的货柜运输公司-长荣海运集团，在周四为部分员工`发放了` `高达`40个月的薪水的年终奖。

According to local media reports, some Evergreen Marine employees 
{{< popover origin="were rumored" title="sb be rumored: 据传某人..." >}}
*e.g.* The girl was unhappy for being rumored to have a boyfriend.
{{< /popover >}} 
to have each received some NT$2 million(US$72,312) in bonus.

据当地媒体报道，据传长荣海运的一些员工每人获得了约200万新台币的奖金。

A couple who were both `entry-level` supervisors at Evergreen told China Times Thursday that they received a combined NT$5 million year-end bonus. The two said they 
{{< popover origin="earn a base salary of" title="earn a base salary of:底薪是..." >}}
*e.g* I earn a base salary of 1800 yuan in our company.
{{< /popover >}}
 NT60,000 and that they have been working at the company for over 10 years.

一对同为长荣的`入门级`主管夫妇周四告诉中国时报，他们加起来共获得了5百万新台币的年终奖。两人称他们底薪6W新台币并且已在公司工作超过10年。

The shipping giant, however, `declined to confirm` the number of months 
{{< popover origin="except to" title="except to: 只是..." >}}
*e.g.* They do nothing except to say everything will be fine.
{{< /popover >}} 
say that employees each got different amounts and `were compensated accordingly` as the bonus was based on perfromance.

然而这家海运巨头`拒绝公开`奖金月数，只说员工每个人都得到不同的金额并且`得到相应的报酬`，因为奖金是基于绩效的。

### 南非议会被烧毁（South Africa's parliament burns）

A large fire damaged `much of` the Houses of Parliament on Sunday.

周日，一场大火烧毁了议会大厦的`大部分`地方。

Officials warned that the damage to the historic(有历史意义的，historical：古老的) `complex` would be `extensive`.

官员警告说，历史性`建筑群`的损失无疑是`广泛的`。

Officials said the fire spread from an office space on the third of a building adjacent(英[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
美[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
) to the old National Assembly building. 

官员说，大火从靠近旧国会大楼的一栋大楼三楼的一个办公空间蔓延开来的。

Cape Town's Fire and `rescue Service` spokesman warned that the buildings themselves `were at risk of collapse`, `given` the `intense heat of the fire`.

开普敦的消防和`救援服务`发言人警告说，`鉴于`这个`火势猛烈`，建筑本身`存在倒塌的风险`

### 欧盟考虑一个非自由主义的领导人是否为同一阵线(E.U considers whether an illiberal leader belongs)

Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, proudly {{< popover origin="refers to his country as" title="refer to ... as: 把...看作/称为..." >}}
*e.g.* He refers to Jane as his grilfriend.
{{< /popover >}} "illiberal state." `Yet` he has long been treated as just another leader by the Europe Union, which `holds itself up as` a `model` of human rights and the rule of law.

匈牙利总理Vitor Orban自豪地称他的国家是一个“非自由主义国家”。`然而`，长期以来，他被欧盟视为仅仅是另一个欧盟的领导人，欧盟则`将自己视为`人权和法治的`典范`。

But as Orban has continued to consolidate power and weaken his country's democratic institutions, the bloc is trying to `rein him in`. Early this year, the European Court of Justice will `issue a decision` on whether the union has the authority to make its funds to memeber states {{< popover origin="conditional on" title="conditional on: 以...为条件" >}}
*e.g.* His compromise is conditional on gaining a lot of money.
{{< /popover >}} meeting the bloc's core values. Doing so may {{< popover origin="block Hungary from billions of euros" title="block sb. from sths: 阻止某人获得某物" >}}
*e.g.* His aunt is trying to block him from a legacy of $500,00
{{< /popover >}}.

但是，随着Orban继续巩固权力并削弱其他国家的民主机构，欧盟试图`抑制他`。今年年初，欧洲法院就欧盟是否有权以符合欧盟核心价值观为条件向成员国提供资金而`做出裁决`。这样做可能会阻止匈牙利获得数十亿的资金。
