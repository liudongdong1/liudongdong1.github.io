### 1. [ResMLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03404)

> ResMLP, an architecture built entirely upon `multi-layer perceptrons for image classification`. It is a simple residual network that alternates (i) `a linear layer in which image patches interact, independently and identically across channels, `and (ii) a `two-layer feed-forward network in which channels interact independently per patch`. When trained with a modern training strategy using heavy data-augmentation and optionally distillation, it attains surprisingly good accuracy/complexity trade-offs on ImageNet.
