<b>DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of
user-defined body parts with deep learning</b>
</div>


#### Summary

1. present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks;
2. by labeling only a few hundred frames, one can train tailored, robust feature detectors that are capable of localizing a variety of experimentally relevant body part;

#### Proble Statement

- inhomogeneous illumination; transparent side walls that appear dark; shadows around the mouse from over head lighting; distortions due to a wide-angle lens; the frequent crossing of the mouse over the odor trail; the common occurrence of rewards directly in front of its snout;

previous work:

- physical markers;
- fit skeleton or active contour models13-17;
- training regressors based on various computationally derived features to track particular body parts in a supervised way;

#### Methods
