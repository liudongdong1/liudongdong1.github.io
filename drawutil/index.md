### 1. [XChart](https://github.com/knowm/XChart)

> XChart is a light-weight and convenient library for plotting data designed to go from data to chart in the least amount of time possible and to take the guess-work out of customizing the chart style.
>
> Create a `XYChart` instance via `QuickChart`, add a series of data to it, and either display it or save it as a bitmap.
