# NBIOT 调研


### 1. background

1. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) has become an exciting new trend in the development of the wireless communication system since it was first proposed as a class of wireless technology used for machine-to-machine (M2M) or Internet of Things (IoT) communications in 2013。（ such as LTE-M, weightless, SigFox, LoRa, and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT)）
2. longer lifetime of nodes, lower transceiver chip cost, and larger coverage area
3. LPWA market  fragmented and non-standardized,poor reliability, poor security, high operational and maintenance costs. 
4. NB-IoT that was standardized in Release 13 of 3GPP’s specification in 2016 is one of the leading emergent technologies
5. provide high coverage (20 dB improvement compared to GPRS), low device power consumption (a battery life of up to more than 10 years), low delay sensitivity (less than 10 s), massive capacity (cellsite sector, at least 52,547 devices), and ultralow device cost (less than $5)

6. NB-IOT overcomes the above defects, with all the advantages like wide area ubiquitous coverage, fast  upgrade of existing network, low-power consumption guaranteeing 10 year battery life, high coupling,  low cost terminal, plug and play, high reliability and high carrier-class network security, unified  business platform management. 
7. NB-IOT makes it possible for more things to be connected, but also managing the commercial value  of the resulting Big Data is a big task, operators can carry out cooperation with related industries,
8. Coverage, battery life and device cost.Mobile devices working on GSM, 3G and LTE are designed for a  variety of services, including mobile voice, messaging and high-speed data transmission. However, NBIoT applications do not utilize any of this; they just require low-speed but reliable data transfer, and an  appropriate level of reliability

### 2. NBIOT Technical Features

1. ![](https://gitee.com/github-25970295/blogImage/raw/master/img/1567299061890.png)
2. **The NB-IOT deployment scenarios**   Guard Band, In Band and Stand Alone![](https://gitee.com/github-25970295/blogImage/raw/master/img/1567299120027.png)
3. **Low band, an excellent choice for fast deployment** Deploying NB-IOT in frequency bands like 700MHz, 800MHz, and 900MHz is a great choice  because they provide an already large and established ecosystem since quite a number of operators  select them; 

### 3. UseCases
